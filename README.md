## Description

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects and skills. The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It features a modern and responsive design, with various sections highlighting different aspects of my work and expertise.

## Frontend Features

- **React:** Utilizing the latest version of React (v18.2.0) for a dynamic and efficient user interface.
- **Material-UI:** Styling components with Material-UI (v4.12.4) and incorporating icons from MUI (v5.11.16).
- **Three.js Integration:** Implementing 3D graphics using Three.js (v0.151.3) through React Three Fiber (v6.0.13).
- **Scroll Animation:** Enhancing user experience with smooth scrolling using React Scroll (v1.8.9).
- **API Integration:** Connecting with external services using Axios (v1.4.0) and the Sendinblue API SDK (v8.5.0).

## Backend Features

- **Express Server:** Building a robust backend server using Express.js (v4.16.2). Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing a set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **CORS Handling:** Managing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with the CORS package (v2.8.5) to ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend, especially when making requests from different origins.
- **Environment Variables:** Managing configurations with the dotenv package (v16.3.1). Using environment variables helps secure sensitive information, such as API keys or database connection strings.
